## Ship Name
### JSON File
```json
{
	"name": "",
	"aliases": ["", ""],
	"image": "",
	"mass": 50,
	"cargoCapacity": 10,
	"hyperdrive": 2,
	"firepower": 100,

}
```
### Balance
_Have you considered the balance of this ship? (e.g. firepower vs defense against a similar sized ship)_
_Note: It is intended in future that Ships with a large cargo capacity could treat that capacity as hangar space, using the ship mass as the weight_

### Research
_For any of the images/stats/data that inspired this item - where did you find the information?_
